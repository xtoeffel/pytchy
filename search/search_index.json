The following chapters show you how to print the help screen in the shell. Windows Executable Executables can be called directly (from Command line or PowerShell ): pytchy.exe -h This will print the help screen. Powershell requires to call .\\pytchy.exe . Python Interpreter Make sure to activate the environment if you use conda by conda activate pytchy . This applies to all all operating systems. Linux or MacOS allow the script to be called directly (with or without file extension .py ): ./pytchy.py -h ./pytchy -h Windows does not support direct execution of Python scripts from a command line. On Windows use instead: python pytchy.py -h The GUI Windows Executable Simply run the executable directly by double-click or from a shell or terminal.

Each distinct color is converted to a symbol. The picture is then converted into a symbol plot where each pixel is a symbol (the symbol of the pixel color). Different symbol-sets are supported: default - Default symbols like geometric shapes and signs letters - Upper and lower case letters from [A-Z][a-z] filled - filled symbols skinny - skinny symbols The number of supported colors equals the number of symbols in the symbol set. How many colors a symbol set supports can be printed in the command line by: ./pytchy -s <symbol-set> -m The GUI will show the number of supported colors as a symbol set is selected. PNG File Recommended is to reduce the number of colors to about 16 , unless you want to challenge yourself. Gimp is a great tool for image manipulation just in case you do not have a favorite yet. Observe : Pytchy will fail or halt if the PNG contains too many colors. Select a different symbol-set which supports more colors or reduce the number colors. As for the colors, the same applies to the size. Anything above 200 x 200 (width x height) is most likely too big. Again, unless you like the challenge. Output, Cross Stitch Pattern Stitch pattern files are written in the directory where the PNG file is located. 3 HTML files are generated from a PNG file: color plot stitch pattern legend (symbol to color) Example The example is based on the PNG file img/Pelican1.png within the pytchy folder. The file is prepared with colors reduced to 15 and size set to 70 x 117 . Technically, it has 16 colors as transparent is treated as a RGBA color. This uses the default symbol set. For completeness, first check that the number of supported colors is sufficient. ./pytchy -s default -m The output reads: Maximum permitted number of colors is 64. To generate the stitch pattern files call: ./pytchy -p img/Pelican1.png -s default This writes the following files.: img/Pelican1_color_plot.html - color plot img/Pelican1_stitch_pattern.html - stitch pattern with symbols img/Pelican1_legend.html - color to symbol legend Note : The HTML files will always be written in the folder of the image file.","title":"How To"},{"location":"how-to/#how-does-it-work","text":"Each distinct color is converted to a symbol.
